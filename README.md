# Fifth Time's The Charm

An AU where Asami sends mild, subtle thirst traps and Korra gets a heart attack every time but only replies with practical feedback because she’s convinced herself she’s only being solicited for friendly advice.


## Summary

Asami tries to guage for interest while Korra tries to be the best *friend* she can be.

> &hellip;Knowing would be worth it, she decides, but she wouldn't take the plunge without testing the waters. She would want to at least know if there is even an inkling of interest from Korra before she lays it all on the line&hellip;


## Author's Notes

This is definitely for fun. It's kind of superficial and dumb, and just short of meme tier really. I'd definitely say the means of presenting the story was more of a motivation than the content itself.

### Links

The fic can also be found on AO3 and the art is dumped on my Tumblr.

## Dev Notes

The main idea was to emulate pop-up texting trope some how. Initially thought of animation with After Effects and just embed a gif or html video. 

But I thought why not emulate it in code? I'm extra.

These little projects are a learning/practice opportunity for me so I tried to explore a couple of things.
